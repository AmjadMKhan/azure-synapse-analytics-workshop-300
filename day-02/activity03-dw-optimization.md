# Activity 03: Data Warehouse Optimization

```
Choose distribution, partitioning and indexing, load staging, dimension and fact tables, optimize load perf

Provide a query against 5 round robin, no-part tables with convoluted joins. Given what you have learned, optimize these.
Include filter.
Consider opportunity to apply NCI
Output should be faster query and simplified query plan (e.g., with no shuffles in it).
