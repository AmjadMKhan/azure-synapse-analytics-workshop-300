# Coach guidance

## What does a coach do

### Teams

* Facilitate collaboration​
* Set expectations​
* Ask leading questions, offer resources instead of answers​
* Encourage creativity​
* Problem solve: technical and interpersonal

### Manage sentiment

* Content will be challenging and **frustrating** at times​
* Let them be challenged but not blocked​
* Check in frequently and raise any issues or what is working well

## Some things to keep in mind

* No step-by-step instructions or "right" answer​
* Not all pain points are removed​
* Everyone should be learning and having fun. That includes YOU!​
* Keep Challenge Content and reference solutions private​

> Teams may not complete all challenges. However, if they are unable to import all data in the first challenge, they can safely move on to the remaining challenges.
